# Insurgency Theaters
These are the theaters I created which modify Insurgency. A lot of the mods I created have been put in the main game, so these theaters change a lot less than they used to.
* [8 Player Survival](8player_survival.theater): Adds two more player slots to Survival mode
* [Bolt Action Only](boltaction_only.theater): Removes all primaries except bolt-actions.
* [Coop 16 Player](coop_16players.theater): Creates a second identical squad for Checkpoint mode to have more players (requires my cooplobby SourceMod plugin)
* [Very Not Fun](default_training-007.theater): The theater currently in use on [my servers](http://stats.jballou.com).
  * Adds 16 player slots
  * Replaces default classes with Recon, Rifleman, Specialist, and Support. Each has a wide range of weapons.
  * Adds 48 bot slots
  * Adds MK48 LMG
  * Replaces M590 with Saiga 12K
  * Replaces M40 with MacMillan TAC-50
  * Increase all grenades to carry 5 each
  * M249 and MK48 can switch out bipod for foregrip
  * Heavy Barrel available on M249/MK48
  * MK4 7x scope can be added to M16 or M249/MK48
  * Removed all class restrictions
  * Removed all weight
  * Removed all supply costs for Security
  * Increased C4 damage and greatly increased through-wall damage fro demo breach
  * Increased IED explosion radius, penetration not changed
* [Very Not Fun NG](verynotfun.theater): Next iteration, almost everything stripped out and redoing it from scratch.
